# 🌿 WildEcho

WildEcho is a quiet corner of the web inspired by forests, mountains, and deep blue oceans.

It’s a simple nature blog where large images, soft typography, and open space work together to tell stories — slowly, without noise.

Built as a small experiment in design and calmness, WildEcho focuses on mood over complexity and presence over perfection.
